    <h1>Feb 3 to June 23 Github Commits / "Updates"</h1>
    <p>Everything was mostly reworks upon reworks as i kept getting problems. One of the recent commits had a breakthrough where i finally got a button to do something upon hovering. I then got through another breakthrough recently where i can now put div's horizontally.</p>
