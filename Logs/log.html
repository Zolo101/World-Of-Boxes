        <h4 style="font-size: 20px;margin-left: 25px;font-family: sans-serif;">The "Go away levelupstall! Nobody likes you!" Update</h4>
        <h3>What's happened?</h3>
        <p>+Simple saving system. No export or import yet :(</p>
        <p>-Removed the Level up stall button. While it was a nice idea, in the long run it'll just make things much harder to add in. Maybe in another version?</p>
        <p>*Went from css to scss (not fully, yet). If for some reason the scss doesn't work, you can download this game on github and link the stylesheet to main.css instead of sass.css although <b>the main.css file will not be updated anymore.</b></p><br>

    <h1>0.04 - 17/08/18</h1>
    <h4 style="color: navy;font-size: 20px;transform:skewX(10deg);margin-left: 25px;">The CSSCompletion Update</h4>
    <h2>Main features</h2>
    <p>+Added Stall, the first expasion. This might be called something else in 0.05. Maybe Workshop?</p>
    <p>+Added Hammer</p>
    <p>+Partially added the smelter.</p>
    <p>+Revamped CSS. As you may have guessed by the title, i have finally added non-broken css to the incremental, Although i will probably revamp this again around 1.0</p>
    <h3>Other features</h3>
    <p>+Opening and closing headers. I really like this function and i hope you like it too.</p>
    <p>*Stall is now a upgrade, and not a building.</p>
    <p>*Screwdriver is now a building, and not a upgrade.</p>
    <p>+Debug and Manual Ticks button.</p>
    <p>+Settings although they do nothing.</p>

    <h1>Feb 3 to June 23 Github Commits / "Updates"</h1>
    <p>Everything was mostly reworks upon reworks as i kept getting problems. One of the recent commits had a breakthrough where i finally got a button to do something upon hovering. I then got through another breakthrough recently where i can now put div's horizontally.</p>
